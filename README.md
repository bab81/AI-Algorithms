This repo contains implementation of various Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

#  KMeans vs SOM Algorithms
Assignment 9 - This compares performance of KMeans vs SOM algorithms while trying to find dominant colors in an image for the purpose of compression.

# Combining Unsupervised and Supervised
22. By combining SOM with Logistic Regression, we can enhance the effectiveness of our prediction. Note how clustering will 'reduce' the amount of data into clustering, potentially making LGR more effective.


# Feature Engineering
23. Changing features from cartesian to polar form can potentially greatly enhance the results of LGR (linear classifier).

# Automated Feature Engineering
24. Multi-Layer Perceptron is an automated feature transformer.

# Feature Tranformation using PCA
25. Converting a 3-d space into 2-d using PCA.
